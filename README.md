And yes it is friendly guide for you to start learning Go lang :)

## Why I am interesting in Golang?
As Full-Stack Developer at [TakeMeTour](https://www.takemetour.com). I've wrote a ton of JavaScript code (Because we are using JavaScript both on Client and Server side). And yes it's kind of boring sometime to wrote the same language everyday. So I try to learn something new and I found out that Golang is one of the interesting choice on this day.

And hear is another reason
- My friend told me that this language is so awesome?
- So I ask him. "Why?".
- He said that he has one project rewrite to Golang from Python and result is **reducing physical machine from 10 machines into just *TWO* machines.** (SO IT IS REALLY FAST)
- This language created by Google.
- I want to learn something new as I've said!!!!!.

## What I have here?
- `src` folder contains all code ordering by number (so it will be from basic to more advance one)
- `journey` folder contains all my side-note **It can be act like reading tutorial with simplified wording and working example!**

## Disclaimer (for myself and anyone who passed by)
> I am starting to write in English for git repository (If you've seen my previous repo you will see that most of it are wrote in Thai) so **"Sorry for my bad English BTW."** and **Feel free to correct my grammar via submitting a pull request :)**
